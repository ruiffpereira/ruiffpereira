## Hi there, i'm Rui Fernandes ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate Front-End Developer who loves crafting beautiful, responsive, and user-friendly web interfaces. With a strong background in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, elegant solutions. My journey in front-end development started with a curiosity for how websites are built, and it quickly turned into a full-fledged passion.

About Me
I thrive on bringing designs to life and ensuring that users have the best experience possible when interacting with a website. Iâ€™m constantly exploring new front-end technologies and frameworks, staying up-to-date with the latest trends to enhance my skills and deliver top-notch work.

Whether it's building a dynamic single-page application, optimizing a site for performance, or creating a seamless user experience, I find joy in every step of the development process. My goal is to make the web a more beautiful, accessible, and enjoyable place, one line of code at a time.

Technologies & Tools I Love
Languages: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), TypeScript
Frameworks/Libraries: React, NextJs, SASS, Tailwind CSS
Tools: Git, NPM, VS Code, Figma
Other Interests: UI/UX Design, Web Performance Optimization, Accessibility (a11y)

Feel free to explore my repositories to see some of the projects I've worked on and contributed to. I'm always open to collaboration and love connecting with like-minded developers!
